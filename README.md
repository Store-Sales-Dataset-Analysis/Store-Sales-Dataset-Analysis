## Project Idea

The **Store Sales Dataset Analysis** is designed to provide decision-makers with a clear and engaging view of business performance.  
By integrating and analyzing superstore sales data, the dashboard uncovers key insights such as top-selling products, regional sales trends, customer behavior, and shipping efficiency.  

The dashboard supports strategic decisions by visualizing:
- Sales performance across categories, products, and regions.  
- Customer purchasing behavior and segmentation.  
- Shipping methods and delivery performance.  
- Regional trends and growth opportunities.
